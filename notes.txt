Project setup — Create folder and initialize npm

1. Create a project folder on your drive (for example: C:\Users\<you>\Documents\MyApp).
2. Open the folder in VS Code:
   - In File Explorer navigate to the folder, click the address bar, type `cmd`, and press Enter to open a terminal at that folder.
   - In that terminal run `code .` to open VS Code in the folder.
   - (Alternative) Right-click the folder and choose "Open with Code".
3. Open the VS Code integrated terminal: press Ctrl+` or choose View → Terminal.
4. Initialize npm in the terminal: run `npm init` (or `npm init -y` to accept defaults).

Next steps (optional): install dependencies with `npm install`, create source files, and start your project.
